<!-- Description / about project-->
This is a personal project that seeks to provide the foundations of programming and some technologies, seeking to learn in a practical and efficient way. The name of the robot is based on the hardware of the Lego Mindstorms robot line, but the OS was changed to Ev3dev, which gives more freedom for programming and connection with the robot, thanks to this it can be programmed using Python. Nova has the ability to solve any variant of the 3x3 Rubik's cube, thanks to a complex algorithm used by professionals to solve this type of Rubik's cube.
 
The project is based on the idea  of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a robot with Lego Mindstorms Ev3 hardware that will have Ev3dev as software, this software being installed with the help of a microSD memory, the algorithm being created in the Python programming language and given the computer communication. robot using the SSH encrypted communication protocol during the robot development phase. This robot has the ability to autonomously and interactively solve any variant of a 3x3 Rubik's cube that may be presented, this is achieved by using the sensors and motors that come in the EV3 Kit, managing to coordinate all these sensors and motors for a harmonious work avoiding friction. Knowing the pieces, the notation and the algorithm to solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube was carried out in Python using one of the best IDE for this language, Pycharm which belongs to JetBrains.
